# Brief explanation

Mobile application which uses a loot box system (generally used in video games) for stores. The loot box model is based on the psychology of chance like in gambling but isn’t classified as gambling by law. 

The application gives incentive for our customers’ customers to go to businesses which use our product. When a customer visits a store that uses our application and makes enough purchases, they receive a box which contain randomized coupons. These coupons give discounts which may be in up to 95% in extremely rare cases, just so that it’s a possibility. The coupons and the application are configured on a per customer basis.


All users of our application receive a currency of our own which can be used to unlock some collectibles in the application. This is basically monopoly money but gives an incentive to go to stores which use our application.
